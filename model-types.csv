Approach,Type,Pros,Cons,Example R package,When I use it
Generalized linear models,model-based,"Relatively simple, good starting point, allows different response distributions (e.g. counts, binary)","Only allows linear relationships, doesn't model spatial AC","base R, glm() function","Small or simple datasets, initial exploration of data"
Generalized least squares,model-based,"Relatively simple, can model spatial AC","Only allows linear relationships, only for normal distributed data","nlme, gls() function","Rarely, as I barely ever find the normal distribution is useful for ecological data"
Generalized additive models,model-based,"Allows for  non-linear relationships, very flexible model forms can be specified, can model spatial AC and different distributions",,mgcv package,"Basically everything these days, its such a versatile approach"
Bayesian hierarchical GLMs,model-based,"Allows for very flexible model forms can be specified, user can develop their own models, can model spatial AC and different distributions, can use prior information, can have GAM like splines, more completely model uncertainty","Slow computation times, requires higher technical knowledge to develop own models",brms and inla,When I want to use priori information or create my own hierarchical models (when GAMs don't cut it)
Point process models,model-based,Useful for presence-only data,"Depends on R package used for implementation, but in general this data type has lower power than presence absence or count data","spatstat, can be implmented in any package, e.g. INLA*",For presence only data
Joint models,model-based,"Model multiple species and their assocations, other strenghts same as as above for Bayesian hierarchical models","As above for Bayesian models, also can be complex and very slow to fit","hmsc, boral, or write your own with stan or jags",Multispecies modelling and quantifying associations among species
Boosted regression trees,machine learning,Can handle data driven flexible non-linear relationships,"No uncertainty intervals, can't handle spatial AC (but AC can be accounted for in training design)",dismo,Only for non-spatial problems
Neural network random effectgs,Hybrid,"Flexible relationships and multiple species, efficient for large datasets","Computationally intensive, 'black box'",mistnet,I haven't but am keen to try!
Neural hierarchical models,Hybrid,"Flexible relationships and multiple species, efficient for large datasets, can fit process based models","Computationally intensive, 'black box'",none yet in R,I haven't but am keen to try!
